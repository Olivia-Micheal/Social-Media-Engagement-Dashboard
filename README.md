## About the Dataset

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and consists of user engagement records from four major social media platforms over a 10-day span. The raw data was spread across **three separate CSV files**, which were **appended and cleaned using Power Query**. It includes columns such as likes, shares, comments, impressions, platform, post type, gender, and emotion.

##  Business Problem

As a data analyst, youâ€™ve been tasked by a social media marketing agency to assess engagement performance across different platforms. The agency wants quick, actionable insights to improve campaign strategy. Key questions include:
- Which platform generated the highest engagement?
- What types of posts performed best?
- Which gender engaged most actively?
- How did engagement change over the 10-day period?
- What were the dominant emotional reactions?

2. **Engagement by Gender** â€“ Donut chart comparing male, female, and non-binary activity  
3. **Platform Performance** â€“ Ranked horizontal bar chart comparing platforms by engagement  
4. **Posts Per Day** â€“ Clustered bar chart showing frequency of posts  
5. **Emotion Distribution** â€“ Bar chart visualizing dominant emotional responses across platforms

##  Insights & Observations

- **Instagram** generated the highest total engagement during the 10-day period.  
- **Day 4** recorded the peak engagement, followed by **Day 6** and **Day 3** â€” suggesting a midweek trend spike.  
- **LinkedIn** posted consistently across all days, while **Instagram** showed sharper performance peaks.  
- **Female users** were the most active demographic in terms of engagement.  
- The **top user emotion** throughout the period was **Neutral**, indicating positive audience sentiment.  
- Engagement per user was relatively strong across platforms, with minimal variance.  
- Emotional responses such as **Anger** and **Sadness** were notably lower, suggesting successful content tone and targeting.

##  Challenges Encountered

- The dataset was originally split across **three separate files**, which required appending and aligning in Power Query.  
- Several columns had inconsistent or incorrect **data types**, which were manually adjusted.  
- Encountered and **replaced data errors** during the Power Query cleaning stage.  
- Understanding the **Power Pivot interface** and applying DAX formulas accurately as a first-time user required several iterations.  
- Aligning card design, colors, and icons for professional presentation took additional formatting effort.

## Conclusion

This project deepened my practical experience with **Power Query**, **Power Pivot**, and **DAX** within Excel. I successfully combined multiple datasets, cleaned and transformed the data, designed calculated KPIs, and presented insights through an engaging dashboard layout. Beyond the technical work, I strengthened my understanding of **dashboard storytelling**, **layout design**, and **user-centered thinking** â€” all critical to real-world analytics work.

This is the **second project** in my Excel portfolio and a milestone in my journey toward becoming a data analyst.
